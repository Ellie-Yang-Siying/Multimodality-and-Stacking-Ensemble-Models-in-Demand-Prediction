# Multimodality and-Stacking Ensemble Models in Demand Prediction

## Project Overview
This project explores the use of multi-modal machine learning models to predict the likelihood of a successful deal on Avito, Russia's largest classified advertisement platform. By integrating tabular, text, and image data, we demonstrate that ensemble learning and deep feature extraction significantly improve predictive performance.

## Methods
- **Tabular Data**: Extracted categorical and numerical features.
- **Text Data**: Extracted embeddings using TF-IDF, SpaCy, and FastText.
- **Image Data**: Extracted embeddings using ResNet50.
- **Ensemble Learning**: Applied stacking models to improve predictions.
